title: About
---

I am happily maried to Laurel, the love of my life, have two children, Jacob and Adriel, who I treasure, and one grandchild, Rhodes Wilder, who keeps me young.

I love jazz, play guitar and a few other instruments, and enjoy software development. I've had the good fortune to travel much of the world as a musician.

Over the years, I
was trained and worked in the field of electronics,
studied music and worked as a musician,
lived and worked for many years with an inner-city non-profit in Chicago,
developed a guitar synthesizer before you could buy such a thing and traveled around the world playing it,
studied theology and worked as a pastor,
studied many computer languages and paradigms of computing,
got hooked on functional programming.

I work for Highland Solutions in Chicago IL, have done so since 2002, and currently reside in Appleton WI.
